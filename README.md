EnvGit runs another command with env. variables loaded directly from file in git repository.

    envgit --url https://github.com/my/repo --file devel.env ./run_my_app.sh

## Motivation

I fall into situations, where I wanted to have centralized and versioned configuration but I 
wanted to avoid installation of systems like Consul. I needed something very simple and lightweight. 

I wrote this tool as response for my need - having easy to set up, easy to manage centralized and 
versioned configuration.

## How to use

The best way how to explore how you can use envgit is by help:

    envgit --help

Let's imagine we have `customapp` which is using Postgres and this can be configured via env. variables.
The configuration for QA environment placed in `customapp/qa.env` file, in our private repository `http://github.com/company/config-repo`. 
We will run the application as follows:

    envgit --url https://github.com/company/config-repo --username usr --password token --file customapp/qa.env ./customapp
    
The command will download the `customapp/qa.env` file from `main` branch, set env. variables and execute the `./customapp` 
with these env. variables.
