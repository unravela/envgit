EnvGit runs another command with env. variables loaded directly from file in git repository.

    envgit --url https://github.com/my/repo --file devel.env ./run_my_app.sh

## Motivation

I fall into situations, where I wanted to have centralized and versioned configuration but I 
wanted to avoid installation of systems like Consul. I needed something very simple and lightweight. 

I wrote this tool as response for my need - having easy to set up, easy to manage centralized and 
versioned configuration.
    
    
## How to use

The best way how to explore how you can use envgit is by help:

    envgit --help

Let's imagine we have `customapp` which is using Postgres and this can be configured via env. variables.
The configuration for QA environment placed in `customapp/qa.env` file, in our private repository `http://github.com/company/config-repo`. 
We will run the application as follows:

    envgit --url https://github.com/company/config-repo --username usr --password token --file customapp/qa.env ./customapp
    
The command will download the `customapp/qa.env` file from `main` branch, set env. variables and execute the `./customapp` 
with these env. variables. 

## How to use with Docker

Let's imagine we want to dockerize our `customapp` and we want to load configuration from centralized Git repository.
We need to download the `envgit` into container, set the variables like `ENVGIT_URL` and then, we can run 
`customapp` via `envgit`. 

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.7

WORKDIR /opt
COPY ./customapp /opt/customapp

RUN wget https://github.com/unravela/envgit/releases/download/v0.1.0/envgit_0.1.0_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz \
    && tar -xzf envgit_0.1.0_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin \
    && rm -rf ./envgit_0.1.0_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz

ENV ENVGIT_URL https://github.com/company/config-repo

CMD envgit /opt/customapp
```

When we build the image and run the container like this:

```
docker run -e ENVGIT_FILE=customapp/qa.env customapp:latest
```

Then the `cusomapp` will start with QA settings.

## Installation

Currently the APK package is not present. I would like to provide also APK but I'm waiting to
[go-releaser APK support](https://github.com/goreleaser/nfpm/pull/126).
